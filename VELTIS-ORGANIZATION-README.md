# Veltis Project Organization

This document provides an overview of the work completed to organize and improve the Veltis project.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Frontend Application**
   - Implemented UI components for authentication and dashboard
   - Created layouts for main application and dashboard
   - Fixed routing and authentication flow
   - Added mock data for development purposes
   - Set up wallet connection functionality

2. **Organized Repositories**
   - Separated code into appropriate repositories:
     - `veltis-frontend`: UI components, pages, and frontend logic
     - `veltis-backend`: API services and database integration
     - `veltis-contracts`: Smart contracts for tokenization and fractionalization
     - `veltis-docs`: Documentation for all aspects of the project
     - `veltis-project`: Main project repository with overall information

3. **Created Automation Scripts**
   - `organize-and-push.sh`: Organizes code into the appropriate repositories and commits changes
   - `push-to-github.sh`: Pushes changes to GitHub repositories
   - Setup correct file permissions and directory structure

4. **Added Project Documentation**
   - Created `README-PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md` explaining project organization
   - Updated status documentation in the docs repository
   - Added guidelines for maintaining clean repository organization

## How to Use the Repository Organization

1. **Development Workflow**
   - Use the `temp_veltis-*` directories for active development
   - Test changes locally using the provided run scripts
   - Run `./organize-and-push.sh` to sync changes to the appropriate repositories
   - Run `./push-to-github.sh` to push changes to GitHub

2. **Running the Frontend Locally**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd temp_veltis-frontend`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the development server: `npm run dev`
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the Tokenization Engine**
   - Finish implementing the IPNFT smart contracts
   - Connect frontend to the smart contracts
   - Add form validation and error handling

2. **Implement Fractionalization**
   - Complete the fractionalization contracts
   - Add UI for fractionalization process
   - Integrate with tokenization engine

3. **Build the Marketplace**
   - Implement buying and selling of fractional tokens
   - Add order book and transaction history
   - Create user dashboard for tracking investments

4. **Add Analytics and Reporting**
   - Implement dashboard for project performance
   - Create visualizations for token performance
   - Add reporting functionality

## Conclusion

The project has been successfully reorganized with a clear structure and improved code organization. The frontend application now functions correctly and can be further developed. The next steps involve completing the tokenization engine, implementing fractionalization, building the marketplace, and adding analytics functionality.
